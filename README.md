# Engineering Culture momentum

This document will contain all my thoughts, ideas, struggles, examples of Engineering Culture (EC) and the way we can define it in the company.

## What is EC?

In a growing company, it is crucial to have standards, a code of conduct, governance, best practices, and so on.
All the above can form the kernel of EC at the company, pre-define it, and seed it in the engineers' mindset.

EC is the set of common beliefs and values that will later impact the way people make decisions or actions around software development. So in this case we can turn all the standards, best practices, tooling, etc. into an EC when they are adopted and become common for every single person.

## Why is it important to define EC?

Most engineers who are happy at their job happen to work at a company with a great EC. Likewise, unhappy engineers happen to be part of a company with a not-so-great engineering culture. Company with good EC empowers and enables everyone sides to grow and develop, both engineers and company.

## Ideas and insights

- Participate in company's internal podcast about the process we are coming through
- Presenting reuslts in the RnD monthly
- Blog post about the EC in the company (once we are done)

## Defininitions by other companies

- [The Guardian](https://github.com/guardian/our-engineering-culture) - perfect match, has the same approach as I was thinking about it: Github repo, developer-first oriented. The structure and content is individual and subject to discuss.
- [ING](https://www.ing.jobs/global/careers/expertise/tech/our-engineering-culture.htm) - to inspire how to create short and descriptive EC page. Looks like one of the pages company shares with candidate during hiring process.
- [Fonoa](https://www.fonoa.com/life-at-fonoa/building-a-world-class-engineering-culture-at-fonoa) - same as above. Doc is not strucutred, still nice to look at.
- [Lyst](https://making.lyst.com/2021/10/21/engineering-principles/) - well structured doc, not long nor short ðŸ¤·.
